"""
Let's go through the first example where you need to find the second occurrence of "s" in a word "sims".
It’s easy to find its first occurrence with a function index or
find which will point out that "s" is the first symbol in a word "sims"
and therefore the index of the first occurrence is 0.
But we have to find the second "s" which is 4th in a row and
that means that the index of the second occurrence (and the answer to a question) is 3.
Input: Two strings.
Output: Int or None
